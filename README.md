# B33rti.me

This is an experimental image uploading site. Its designed to be as lightweight and mobile friendly as possible with no considerations for browser backwards compatibility. 

### TODO
- Tags
- Users
- Direct to S3 uploads
- HTML5 Video
- Search (Needs tags probably)
- Sorting
- API
- Click to animate GIFs
- Make streaming images from S3 less shit

### SETUP

Some `.example` files are provided in the `/config` directory for running this in a similar environment as I do as well as a sample `deploy.rb` for deploying using Capistrano. 

You'll also need to copy and rename `secrets.yml.example` to `secrets.yml` and populate this with your S3 credentials.
